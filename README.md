# Code-Fun-Public
This is a collection, or rather the start of the different code mini projects I want to use to learn new skills, maintain others, and so on, as I have time.  
Which is different from my other, bigger personal projects and is more like "Hey, I got 2 hours to kill, let's watch some slop and code."

It is not meant to be a showcase of special coding skills, but I will add comments, thoughts, and so on. I do not promise the code is the best, but it is part of my general strive to be better.

**Current code fun:**
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) - This is a fantastic Coding puzzle task that is run every year. I recommend that anyone, regardless of skill level, take part in the challenge, as you are likely to learn a lot.  
However, as the creators asked, I won't be providing puzzle input, puzzle text, or anything else. Only my code and thoughts.

**Current progress:**  
**Paused(ish) 2024**: [Python] Switched to 2015 as it should be a bit easier, and I want to get it done before the 2025 events start.  
**Current task 2015**: [Python] Started it in Python.  
When 2025 starts, I will take part, but not daily if I don't have time.

[Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com) - Trying out Code Wars to see what it is like compared to Leetcode, but is it the same kind of thing? It's still only in Python, but moving on to C++ in a bit.

**Future plans:** I plan to do more of them, maybe some Leetcode, and whatever else I can find. I also plan to use other languages, such as C++ and Java, for some of these.  
Who know maybe i will go crazy and try to do this in Structured Text.

**Personal rules:**  
I do not use LLMs for this, as it defeats the purpose of learning and maintaining skills.  
For now, I don't care about achieving the best, fastest score or a perfect, optimal bit of code.

If you read this far, thank you.
